        <h3>Business Challenge & Segmentation Objective</h3>
        <p>Infinity Bank faced a familiar but high-impact problem: not all customers contribute equally to profitability, and treating them the same is expensive. Marketing, risk, and retention teams needed a clearer way to decide who to invest in, who to protect, and where to pull back.</p><br>
        <p>As part of Customer Analytics project, we focused on building a customer segmentation framework that connects data directly to those decisions — identifying customers to prioritize for cross-selling, retain proactively, or manage for risk. This project used customer segmentation and predictive analytics to turn a 2,205-customer weighted sample into clear, decision-ready segments aligned to business actions.</p><br>
        <h3>Segmentation & Modeling Approach</h3>
        <p>We segmented customers based on product depth and financial behavior across three core products: Current Accounts, Credit Cards, and Mortgages. The dataset included 1,000 customers per product-combination segment, allowing consistent comparison across customer types.</p>
        <p>To move from descriptive segmentation to decision-ready insights, we built logistic regression models, each aligned to a specific business question:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Who is most likely to take a credit card?</li>
          <li>Who is at elevated risk of default?</li>
          <li>Which customers are profitable — and which are likely to churn?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Rather than using raw predictions, customers were grouped into high, medium, and low probability segments, ensuring outputs could be directly used by marketing, risk, and collection teams.</p><br>
        <h3>What the Segments Revealed</h3>
        <p><strong>Cross-Sell Opportunity</strong><br>
        The credit card propensity model surfaced a distinct high-propensity segment of 239 customers representing the strongest immediate growth opportunity. These customers showed strong current account balances and revenues, making them ideal targets for focused cross-sell campaigns. Medium-propensity customers could be reached through low-cost channels, while low-propensity customers were intentionally deprioritized to avoid inefficient spending.</p>
        <p><strong>Risk Exposure</strong><br>
        Default risk modeling identified a small but critical subset of 52 customers with significantly higher probabilities of default. Isolating this segment enables earlier intervention and more efficient use of risk management resources, without over-monitoring the broader customer base.</p>

        <p><strong>Profitability & Churn Dynamics</strong><br>
        Profitability analysis showed that credit card revenues and service costs were the primary drivers of customer value. Several commonly assumed predictors, including certain balance and mortgage-related variables, were not statistically significant. Churn risk varied meaningfully by product depth, reinforcing the importance of multi-product relationships in long-term retention.</p>

        <h3>Business Value Delivered</h3>
        <p>This segmentation-driven approach allowed Infinity Bank to move from broad, reactive strategies to focused, data-backed decision-making:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Focus cross-sell efforts on 239 high-propensity customers with the highest expected return</li>
          <li>Proactively manage risk by prioritizing 52 high-risk customers for monitoring and intervention</li>
          <li>Align retention and marketing resources with customers who actually drive profit, rather than relying on surface-level metrics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The result was a clear prioritization framework that leadership could operationalize across teams, balancing growth, risk, and profitability.</p><br>
        <h3>Limitations & Next Iteration</h3>
        <p>The analysis was limited by static, point-in-time data and incomplete customer history. Future iterations would strengthen the framework by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Introducing time-series analysis to capture behavioral change</li>
          <li>Tracking customer movement across product combinations</li>
          <li>Validating cross-sell and retention strategies through A/B testing</li>
          <li>Enriching the dataset with additional behavioral and demographic features</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even with these constraints, the project demonstrates how customer segmentation, when paired with predictive modeling, can directly shape business strategy.</p>
