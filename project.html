        <p>We started by diving into 9,648 sales records from January 2020 through December 2021 to find out what is actually driving our business. We tracked our performance across five different regions and six unique retailers to make sure we had the full picture of our national footprint. Before we drew any conclusions, we cleaned the data to fix messy columns and date formats, ensuring our total sales and operating profit calculations were completely accurate.</p>

        <p>When we looked at the map, the West region stood out as our top performer in both sales and profit. On a more local level, we found that New York is our best-performing state and city, with California, Florida, and Texas following closely behind. On the flip side, our data shows that Omaha and Nebraska are currently at the bottom of our list, which helps us pinpoint exactly where we have the most room to improve our presence.</p>

        <p>We also looked at how customers are buying our gear and found that the online channel is our most profitable, bringing in 41% of our total operating profit. We noticed an interesting split between our retailers: while West Gear sells the highest volume of products, Walmart actually generates the most profit for us, likely due to lower operating costs. As for what is actually in the box, footwear remains our heavy hitter, accounting for 66% of our total sales compared to 34% for apparel.</p>

        <p>Moving forward, our goal is to focus on the Midwest, as it is currently our lowest-selling region. We are planning to increase the demand for apparel in cities like Baltimore and Omaha by introducing new designs (SKUs) and increasing our marketing budgets there. By clearing up supply chain bottlenecks and using smarter pricing based on local demand, we will be able to reach underserved cities much more effectively.</p>
